# GuesstheNumber
A number guessing game that utilizes the random module in Python.

## The Game
This game was my second project for my Python I class to learn how to utilize the random module in Python. It takes the user's input for a minimum and maximum range and then generates a secret number from random. The user then guesses the number generated using their inputed minimum and maximum as a guide as well as the printed statements corresponding with their guess input.

The game was also used to practice passing arguments into functions by passing the guess input into the defined function and looping until a correct answer is given.
